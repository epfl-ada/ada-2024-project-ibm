      <h2> Embarking on a  Quest </h2>
      <p>
        Once upon a time, noble knights embarked on a legendary journey, known as
        <b>  Wikispeedia  </b>. Their quest? Armed only with their wit, 
        they ougth to navigate through a labyrinth of articles 
        to reach their destination.
      </p>
    However, not all of the adventurers emerged victorous; many of them succumbed  
    in the face of adversity and their own frustation. These poors souls became known as <b> quitters </b>. 
    <p>
        Was their lack of skill and perseverance that sealed their fate? Or was it the sheer difficulty of their quest?
        This project <b> The Quitter's Quest</b> seeks to not only find answer to these questions, but uncover the tricks of 
        the <b>Bias Enchantress</b>.

    <!-- Analysis -->
    <div class="section" id="analysis">
      <h2>The Dataset </h2>
      <h3>A Chronicle of Victors and Vanquished  </h3>
      The objective of the quest is clear; given a <b>source article</b> reach the specified <b>target 
        article </b>, using as few clicks as possible. Every article is linked to others through <b>hyperlinks</b>.
      <p>
        In the archives of the kingdom lies a record of every adventurer’s journey:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> <b>Finished quest/games</b>: players reached the target article from a source article successfully.</li>
        <li> <b>Unfinished quest/games</b>: players did not reach the target article. </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        To understand why some fail and others succeed, we must determine whether
    <b>success</b> is dependent on the <b>player's choices</b>,
    or on the <b>difficulty</b> of the game he faces?
</p>
However, given a specific quest (a source and a target), 
how can one estimate its difficulty? 
To answer this, <b>we need a metric to evaluate the true challenge of a path</b>.  
      
      <h3>The Difficulty Conundrum</h3>

        <p>
            We began our quest by exploring <b>player-estimated difficulty</b>.
            Whenever players completed a game,  they rated how challenging they found it,
              but we still lack a <b>metric that
             can extend to all games</b>, whether completed or abandoned.
          </p> 
           
              To address this, we aim to test potential metrics that capture the difficulty of a path. 
              Our approach is to group all games—both finished and unfinished—according to the metric being tested. 
              For each group, we calculate:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Estimated difficulty:</b> The average difficulty rating given by players who completed games in the group.</li>
              <li><b>Failure ratio:</b> The proportion of unfinished games relative to all games in the group.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              By plotting these groups, comparing the estimated difficulty of finished games against the failure ratio, we can evaluate the effectiveness of the metric. 
              A strong correlation between player-estimated difficulty and the failure ratio would indicate that the metric successfully captures the inherent challenge of a path.
            </p>
            <p>
              This approach allows us to explore not only the nature of difficulty but also how it varies across groups of games.

            <p> Intuitively, one might resort to the <b>target</b> to explain the difficulty of a game;

                <ul>
              <li> <b>People </b>  includes modern, popular figures. Without specific knowledge about them, players face challenges finding paths.</li>
              <li> <b>Everyday Life</b>  consists of specific concepts that might not have obvious or direct connections (e.g., Book → Bean) </li>
                  </ul>
              <li> <b>Countries </b> and <b>Geography</b>  rank low in in both difficulty and unfinished game rates.
              <ul>
                 <li> These categories are easier to navigate, with hierarchical connections (e.g., France → Europe → Paris) and general cultural knowledge aiding players.  </li>

              A curious observation arises: <b>Recent History</b> shows a high proportion of unfinished games 
              but a low difficulty rating, while <b>General History</b> has fewer dropouts. 
              Are adventurers more knowledgeable about <b>General History</b> than <b>Recent History</b>?
            </p>
            <div class="illusion-paths">
              Surprisingly, no. A considerable portion of articles in <b>Recent History</b> have high dropout rates (e.g., Hannibal Barca, 
              Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy). In the few games that have been finished, the articles may appear <b>deceptively easy</b> because only
               the most determined or knowledgeable managed to complete them-skewing the difficulty rating.
            </div>
          <p class="illusion-summary">
            To account for this, we filtered target articles with at least two finished games per unfinished one:

<h3>
    Key Insights
</h3>
<p>
    Similarly to before:
    <ul>
        <li> More <b>comparmentalized subcategories</b> (e.g; <b>Novels </b>, <b> Railway Transport</b>) rank high in both difficulty and the proportion of unfinished games.</li>

        <li>  More <b>'general-knowledge'</b> subcategories (e.g;  <b>Languages</b>, <b>European Geography</b>, <b>USA Presidents</b>) rank low in in both difficulty and unfinished game rates,

        </ul>
        </li>
        </p>

        While variability remains, we've uncovered an important insight: concepts with more connections-easier to link-
        provide a less challenging path to navigate through. 
</ul>

  <!-- Conclusion -->
  <div class="section" id="shortest path">
    <h2>Level 3: Delving into the Labyrinth</h2>
    <p>
      To evaluate the linkability of articles:
      <ol>
      <li> We model a <b>graph</b>, where articles are represented as nodes, and links between 
      them form the edges. 
    </li>
  <li>
We then calculate the <b>shortest path length</b>
  between all source and target combinations played in the game. </li>
</ol>

     <p><b>What do we observe?</b>

     <p>
      <b>Could this be the metric we had been searching for?</b>

  <p>
   Indeed, there is almost a  <b>perfect correlation</b> between the ratio of unfinished games and estimated difficulty
    for games according to shortest path length.

     </div>
    

  At last, we have uncovered a <b>metric</b> that allows us to compare games based on their <b>'objective' difficulty</b>. 
  With this newfound knowledge, the maze begins to take shape, and we quickly arrive at the oracle's lair.

      <h2> Level 4: The Oracle's Counsel </h2>

          Your path is not defined by its length alone. The power lies within the nodes you tread.
            Seek them, and master the labyrinth, you shall.
          
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
      The oracle's riddle inspires us to study how the properties of the nodes between the source and target vary across these shortest paths, according
      to two metrics: <b>PageRank</b> and <b>closeness centrality</b>.
    </p>
    <h3> Unlocking the Labyrinth's Secrets</h3>
     
        <div style="text-align: center; padding: 10px">
          <iframe src="html_plots/graph_pagerank_closeness.html" width="100%" height="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe>
       </div>
<h3>Key Insights</h3>
       <ul>
        <li> Both metrics start low, peak at the second or third node, and then decrease till the target. </li>
          

<li><b>PageRank:</b> peaks early as path goes through globally influential hub articles that bridge regions of the graph between source and target. After these hubs, it drops sharply.</li>


<li> <b>Closeness centrality:</b> declines more gradually, reflecting that intermediate nodes, while less globally influential, remain well-connected locally. </li> 

 </ul>
<h3>Into the Depths of the Labyrinth</h3>
  The differences between the metrics highlight how <b>finding the target becomes increasingly challenging as the shortest path lengthens</b>.

  <p>
   While <b>PageRank</b> remains consistently low for nodes along longer paths, indicating a lack of influential connections;
    <b>closeness centrality</b> shows a progressive decline.
  </p> 
    <p>
    This reveals that each successive node in the path becomes less connected to the rest of the graph, forcing players onto a more constrained and isolated route.
    
  </p> 


    
<div class="illusion-section">
  <h3> The Homogeneity Mirage</h3>
  <div class="deception-icon">
    <img src="images/sorcerer.PNG" alt="Sorcerer's Deception Icon" />
  </div>
    <p class="illusion-intro">
      One might assume that all paths with the same shortest length share similar characteristics. For example, the shortest paths have higher initial and final <b>PageRank</b> and <b>closeness centrality</b>. 
    </p>
    <div class="illusion-paths">
      However, this assumption is misleading.
      These metrics' evolutions only represent median attributes along the path, and, as such, do no reflect all possible cases: 
    <ul style="color: #b9e8ff;">
      <li>  Some shorter paths arise because the source and target are close to each other in a locally connected region of the network.</li>
    
      <li>  Others are short because both source and target lie near a global hub.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p class="illusion-summary">
    Ultimately, the focus is not on these metrics themselves but on understanding <b>how difficult the game feels for players</b>, regardless of the underlying reasons. 
    This is why path length is such a powerful measure—it <b>captures both the effects of local and global connectivity</b> .
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="battle-prep">
  <h2>Level 5: The Knight’s Assembly </h2>
  <p>
    Before we face the final challenge, let's take a moment to ensure our analysis makes sense. We’ll study human games, both finished and unfinished, grouped by source-target combinations that have a specific shortest path length.
  </p>
  
    For example, a path with source and target: 'King Arthur' and 'Root Beer' might have a shortest path of 5. Yet, two players can complete the journey differently—one in 4 steps, the other in 6.

  <p>
   For each level of difficulty (shortest path length), we will plot how the players traverse the path's nodes as a function of <b>closeness centrality</b>. 
  </p>

  <div style="text-align: center; padding: 10px">
    <iframe src="html_plots/closeness_all_shortest_paths.html" width="100%" height="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe>
 </div>
  <p>
   We observe that, in most cases, <b>finished games tend to have longer paths than unfinished ones</b>! This makes sense: players who finish often persist and explore more.
  </p> 
    
    
    
    <div class="illusion-section">
      <h3> The Illusion of Numbers </h3>
      <div class="deception-icon">

      </div>
        <p class="illusion-intro">
          However, something unexpected can be observed for games with shortest path length of 4: these games appear to have longer completed paths than those with a shortest path length of 5.
          The same occurs for shortest paths of length 5 and 6, rspectively.


        </p>
        <div class="illusion-paths">
          When we examine the data, we find a significant imbalance in the number of games played for each shortest path length (<b>sampling bias</b>):
          
<ul style="color: #b9e8ff;">
  <li>There are far more games with shortest path length 4 than with 5; and with length 5 than 6. </li>
  <li>   This increases the probability of encountering games with unusually long completed paths, making longer paths seem more common than they truly are for path length 4.</li>
</ul>
          
      <p class="illusion-summary">
        We perform a subsample of 1,000 games for both shortest path lengths 4 and 5. Now, the results align with expectations:
        <p>
        <b>More difficult games, as reflected by longer shortest paths, tend to result in longer completed paths</b>.

  <ul>
   <li><b>Common Strategy</b></li>
   <ul>  <li> All players progress from low-ranked nodes (source) to higher-ranked ones,
    before advancing to nodes with lower values for both metrics. </li></ul> 
  
  <li><b>Victors</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Key to Success</b></li>
    <ul>
    <li>Successful players locate a <b>critical article/node</b>—a node with <b>sufficiently low closeness centrality and PageRank</b> that leads directly to the target; often the penultimate
      or antepenultimate node.
 <li>Once this node is found, conceptual connections to the target seem to become relatively simple.</li>
</li>
</ul>
   <li><b>Good vs Mediocre Players</b></li>
   <ul>

 <li>
<b>Good players</b> (those completing the game in fewer steps) reach the critical node quicker.
 </li> 
 <li> For <b>mediocre players</b> the
  metrics of the nodes visited decrease more or less steadily along the path.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>
  Quitters
</b></li>
<ul>
  <li> Unsuccessful players are able to locate influential nodes and begin decreasing in metrics. </li>
  <li> They <b>fail to find the critical node </b>that leads to the target.</li>
</ul>
  </ul>


  <h3>The Enigma of the Vanquished: Lost on the Path to the Target</h3>
<p></p>
    The <b>steady decrease in metrics</b> along the paths of unsusccesful players suggests that, had they continued searching, <b> they might have eventually found the target</b>.
    Or perhaps, they may have explored paths that, while more specialized, were not conceptually connected to the target.
  </p>
  To understand this dynamic better, we analyze the <b>distance to the target along the paths</b>:

  <div style="text-align: center; padding: 10px">
    <iframe src="html_plots/distance_to_target.html" width="100%" height="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe>
 </div>

  <p>
    For both type of players, there is often a <b>phase of stagnation</b>—remaining at the same distance to the target. 
    Here is where the key lies:
  </p>
<ul>
  <li>
<b>Successful players</b> eventually locate the <b>critical</b> node. From that node on, the distance to the target decreases steadily.
  </li>

  <li>
 <b>Unsusccesful players</b> simply circle near the target without identifying the critical node.
  </li>
</ul>
